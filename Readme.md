# GridView - Text automatically scrolls horizontally when it doesn't fit into cell bounds 


<p>This example demonstrates a creeping line in a grid view cell when its text doesn't fit into its bounds. This feature works together with the cell's tool tip when a user points to a cell with the mouse cursor. It's sufficient to process GridView's CustomDrawCell event to implement this behavior.</p>
